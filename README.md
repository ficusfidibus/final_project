# Final Project
### As a final project for my Data Science course at WBS Coding School I created a machine learning model to predict if a certain chemical has anti biofilm activity.  
### My motivation
After the bootcamp I will start my PhD at the BHT in Berlin. My goal is to find new chemicals that are active against biofilm formation. To directly apply the skills I learned during the Data Science Bootcamp, I decided to do a project related to my upcoming PhD.  
As 'traditional' drug discovery is very resource intensive, ML techniques are widely used and studied to use ML models to predict new drugs.  
During my project I was able to create a first draft of a prediction model to predict the anti-biofilm activity of chemical substances. Building an ML model in not quiet 3 weeks is challenging, so I decided to start from the point of some publications. The main publication from which I used the publicly available data is the following:
