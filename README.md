# Final Project
## As a final project for my Data Science course at WBS Coding School I created a machine learning model to predict if a certain chemical has anti biofilm activity.  
## My motivation
After the Bootcamp I will start my Phd at the BHT in Berlin. My aim is to find new chemicals which are active against biofilm formation. To directly use the competences I have learned during the Data Science Bootcamp I decided to do a project related to my upcoming Phd.  
Since "traditional" drug discovery needs a lot of resources ML technics are broadly used and studied to use ML models to predict new drug.  
During my project I could create a first draft of a prediction model for predicting anti-biofilm activity of chemical substances. Within not quiet 3 weeks building a ML model is challenging, thats why I decided to start from the point of some publications. The main publication from where I used the public available data is the following one: [G. N. Srivastava et. al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.03.020).
